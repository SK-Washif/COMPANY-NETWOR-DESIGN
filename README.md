# COMPANY-NETWOR-DESIGN

There are 500 employees in a trading floor support center. Due to their recent expansion, they must relocate to a new location. Although a building has been located, it lacks a network. This implies that new network services must be created and put into place in the new building before they may move out. The following components make up the current network:

For instance, the new structure is anticipated to feature three levels with two departments each.

1.

First floor (Sales and Marketing Department-100 users expected, Human Resource and Logistics Department-100 users expected)

2. Second floor (Finance and Accounts Department-100 users expected, Administrator and Public Relations Department-100 users expected)

3. Third floor (ICT-120 users expected, Server Room-12 devices expected)

Thus, you have been assigned to design a network for the new building as a key member of the Networks Team. Logical design, which outlines the steps you would take to guarantee that the new network satisfies the present business need and is future-proofed, is now necessary.

# Conditions:

1. To design and deploy the network solution, use Cisco Packet Tracer.

2. Make use of a hierarchical approach that offers redundancy at each tier; it is anticipated that two routers and two multilayer switches will be employed to provide redundancy.

3. In order to offer redundancy, the network should also link to a minimum of two ISPs. Each router should be connected to both ISPs.

4. Wireless networks for users must be available in every department.

5. Every department ought to be located in a distinct subnetwork and VLAN.

6. 192.168.10.0 was provided as the base network, and subnetting was used to assign the appropriate number of IP addresses to each department.

7. The company network is connected to the static, public IP addresses (Internet Protocol) 195.136.17.0/30, 195.136.17.4/30, 195.136.17.8/30 and 195.136.17.12/30 connected to the two Internet providers.

8. Set up the hostnames, console password, banner messaging, and IP domain lookup, among other fundamental device settings.

9. Every department's devices must be able to communicate with one another using the multilayer switch that is set up for inter-VLAN routing.

10. The multilayer switches will be given IP addresses since they are anticipated to perform both routing and switching functions.

11. It is anticipated that any device connected to the network will dynamically receive an IP address from the server room's dedicated DHCP servers.
